layout divs according to twiter bootstrap classes

.col-xs-* class to create grid columns for extra small devices like cell phones
.col-sm-* class for small screen devices like tablets
.col-md-* class for medium size devices like desktops
.col-lg-* for large desktop screens

maximum column widths:
xs - Auto sm - ~62px md -~81px 	lg ~97px
15px gutter width on side of each column.

having a smaller class on a tag will have an affect on a larger side device unless an explicit class is given.

order goes like this: container => row => columns with a class on each one
so for example col-sm-6 takes up 6 of 12 columns.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6"><!--Column left--></div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><!--Column right--></div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6"><!--Column left--></div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><!--Column right--></div>
  </div>
</div>
